            <h2 style="color:#1a2238">About the work</h2>
            <p style="color: black">The intent of this photo series is was to simply give the consumer more of an idea
                of what Balters XPA taste's like.
                <br>After doing some investigation of my own over on thier website i noticed there was lack of visual
                <br>
                discription of the flavour profile for their beers.
                <br>
                <br>
                So naturally i grabbed myself a 6 pack, had a taste and got to work.
                <br>
                <br>
                As i was taking the photos i thought to myself, what could i do to make it look more appealing?
                <br>
                I made the choice to make the green of the can much brighter and sprayed a bit of water<br>
                to make it
                look more refreshing as well as to add another layer to the photos.
                <br>
                With a bit of hard work and some trial and error. Here is the final product.
            </p>

            <h1 style="color: #1a2238">Conway coffee Teasers</h1>

            <p>These teaser videos were made for Conway Coffee (a local Melbourne brand) <br> With the intent to help
                them
                promote their new Vietnamese coffee blend. <br>
                <br>

                I kept the set design and overall feel of the video quiet simple <br>
                By doing so it allows to brand to easliy execute and <br>
                recreate teaser videos similar to the two i have created.
            </p>
